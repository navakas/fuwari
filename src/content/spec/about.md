# About

This is my journal site, built mainly for me to store memories and easy links to photos of travel, and to share them with anyone that might be interested.
Some trips have diary entries, others just links to photos.\
A few non-travel things may be posted on occasion.\
The entries are catalogued this way:\
Each entry has a single Category (eg Travel)\
Each entry has one or more Tags (eg Country, City)\
The ['Diary'](../archive/?tag=Diary) tag indicates a longer text content, rather than just a photo link with minimal text.\
Send me a message at <cloud@andrius.au> if you feel like saying hello.

## Tech stuff

This site is made of static html pages, hosted for free on [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).  
It has been built using the [Astro](https://astro.build) framework for static site generation.

The posts are written in markdown.\
The photos are on Google Photos.\
The posts have links to relevant albums.\
My code editor is Visual Studio Code.

It's quite cool - the source code is hosted on GitHub, and is linked to Cloudflare.  Whenever a new page is added to the repo, Cloudflare triggers an automatic rebuild and publish.  This makes publishing this super easy, and you can't beat free.  All tools used are free or open source.  The whole site was built by me in a few hours.  The template I built this site from is [Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari).  So, a big thanks to the developer!
