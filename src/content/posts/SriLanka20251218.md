Long drive today. 6 hrs. It would have been a train ride, but tourist trains in the highlands won’t be working for many months. A huge reconstruction is underway.  
Raining again. I have not had good weather luck so far. The constant rain will not be helping stabilise the slopes.  
Not a very scenic trip today. The conditional perfect tense is not bringing joy when the topic is great views - on a few moments when the rain cleared🧀 a bit I could see the view would have been awesome.  
Stopped at a tea plantation, Labookellie, for a brief tour & tasting. One of the oldest estates in the country, dating to 1850’s. Tried some rare and expensive white tea.  
There are a lot of Hindu temples in this area. Most tea plantation workers are Hindu Tamil.   
Some advertising slogans really inspire admiration, through creating strong emotional connections, humorous wordplay, or tapping into aspirations. Here’s one sign I saw:
"Sri Lanka produces the best tea in the world.
Hellbodde produces some of it.”  
Really makes you want some….  
Staying at a place called Roseland estate. The cottages are at nearly 1200m, and the view is spectacular, over a valley with mountain ranges in the distance.  It’s the first time on the trip I’ve experienced cold.
