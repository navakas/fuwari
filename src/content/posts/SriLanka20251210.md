Sigiriya Rock (Lion Rock) - an iconic Sri Lankan highlight. 

Another few thousand vertical steps on a hot muggy day. Lost 2kg sweat. A tough walk on the day. Incredibly impressive construction, justifiably one of Sri Lanka’s highlights.

Then a superb lunch (gained 2kg curry) at a local villager’s house, then by tuk-tuk visited a broom maker (made totally by hand), a dance studio for a performance of indigenous dance (I declined an offer of a lesson), a mud hut tea house, and topped off with a body oil production facility (again totally by hand). An odd mix, but interesting. 

Tea here is drunk with jaggery, a palm sugar rock. 
You take a little bite, keep it in your mouth, and drink the hot tea. 
It dissolves a little of the jaggery and makes a great tasting drink. 
It’s really good.
