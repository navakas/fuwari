In Michelin  Guide - no star, but good enough for 1* for sure

Naples

Naples is very grubby - difficult to like. Have avoided Camorra so far. Haven't had time to see the good bits. Have to bargain with taxi drivers - wanted 25euro for a short fare. We said 'No'. Price dropped to 15. We said no & started walking - he drove up to us a minute down the road, & settled on 10...

Sorrento Lunch

Day trip on ferry. This was at 1*Michelin restaurant Lorelei. Exceptional. View & location were 10*. Expensive, but worth it. Sorrento lovely but very crowded.

Matera (& a brief stop at Castelmezzano on the way - just stopped for photos) 3 nights. Could easily have stayed more.

Brief stop in Putignano - just coffee & cake

Agriturismo Masseria Storica Pilapalucci, 3 nights out in the middle of nowhere. Lovely quiet spot among olive & almond groves, some old Trulli, and Slow Food mentioned the restaurant there

Brief stop in Trani - also coffee only

Eating and drinking totally local, as zero km as possible. Haven't been disappointed yet, even by cheapish wines.

Heading back to Rome tomorrow for a few days, then Melbourne, which has far better coffee than anywhere in Italy, and I think Mother Dough in Hawthorn makes better pizzas.
