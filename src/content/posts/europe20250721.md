London

After meetinneeps and tatties lounge at Istanbul, full of pide and menemen, we boarded for London. The plane was ready to take off, when the pilot announced there was a ‘mechanical issue’, and we would taxi back to the gates.

Glad the plane malfunctioned just before takeoff, and not 1 minute later, a la Air India.
We departed eventually 3 or 4 hours late (somewhat concerned). Not sure if they found a new plane, or if it was the same one with some duct tape. I didn’t want to know.

The next few days in London were pleasant, and completely lacking the extremes of Istanbul and Samos. London is ferociously expensive. My ears bled every time we had a coffee.

We found good coffee at Noxy Bros - you actually *can* get a good coffee outside Melbourne.

Most of a day was spent at Kew Gardens - a lovely stroll, with many summer flowers.

A highlight was the British Library, and their collection of old manuscripts. Seeing an original Magna Carta was quite a thrill, as was an original Turing text on Intelligent Machinery - the inspiration for Chat GPT et al. Would we have been better off without Turing? We’ll know in a few years (maybe - I’m probably a blue pill guy, unlike Keanu).

We queued at the Ginger Pig at the Borough Market for their famous sausage roll, which was nice but not living up to the hype. The market was hideously crowded - it’s developed into a bit of a tourist circus, alas.

We had dinner at the iconic Dishoom. No bookings are taken, and we arrived early in anticipation of a seat, only to find another massive queue.  

I was hugely impressed by their client management software. A lady was walking along the queue with a tablet, interviewing diners, and sending people what appeared randomly into the restaurant. When she reached us, took my name, advised a wait of 20 minutes (which seemed implausible), then said to go the the door, and ask for seats A1 at the bar. We had a drink, the bartender assured us ‘they knew where you were’, and very quickly we were greeted by name and escorted to a table the moment one was free (15 minutes). Dishes arrived promptly.

The choreography was as impressive as air traffic control at Changi, in a restaurant almost as large. The food was pretty good, too, by the way. I left marvelling at superb curries and awesome software (they use a system called Aloha EPOS).

We did a few London Walks - one based on the engineer Brunel’s projects building tunnels, bridges, ships and railways, who Jeremy Clarkson nominated as ‘the greatest Briton’, on the basis Brunel built Britain, and therefore the modern world. Brunel came second only to Churchill in a nationwide poll.
Another walk entered around Mayfair, where we saw so many expensive and exclusive shops for the world’s ultra-wealthy ($5-10k for an Apple Watch strap, anyone?), and houses of historic significance, including Spencer House at Green Park.

We were enlightened about a ‘men only’ club, Brooks’s, who eventually allowed women in as guests, but initially only wives of members.

When members sought to expand companion entry to their mistresses as well, it was allowed, as long as the mistresses were wives of existing members…

An interesting club - it featured gambling among members, and a 1785 betting book entry states "Ld. Cholmondeley has given two guineas to Ld. Derby, to receive 500 Gs whenever his lordship fucks a woman in a Balloon one thousand yards from the Earth.” 

We don't know if the bet was ever won, or how it was confirmed. The first Mile High Club?

Next, Scotland - Haggis, black pudding, salmon, venison, neeps and tatties….
